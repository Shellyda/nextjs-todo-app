# NextJS Todo List Board

A Todo List Board Web App designed for managing tasks of varying difficulties, priority levels, and categories. This project serves as a practical exploration of Tailwind UI CSS and NextJS React Framework, with a specific focus on understanding server components and actions. Additionally, it utilizes Jest lib for testing and json-server to simulate an API, enabling seamless interaction between the front-end and back-end components.

## Features 
- **Task Management**: Organize tasks based on different difficulties, priority levels, and categories.
- **Clean Interface**: Tailwind UI CSS favored a customization full of style features such as alerts, animations, transitions, giving visual feedback to users.
- **Status Tracking**: Keep track of changes in task status over time for improved productivity and workflow management.
- **Server Components and Actions**: Utilize NextJS React Framework to implement server components and actions for enhanced performance and functionality.
- **API Simulation**: Employ json-server to simulate an API, enabling seamless communication between front-end and back-end components.

## Technologies Used 
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **[NextJS React Framework](https://nextjs.org/)**: A React framework with server-side rendering capabilities for building fast and scalable web applications.
